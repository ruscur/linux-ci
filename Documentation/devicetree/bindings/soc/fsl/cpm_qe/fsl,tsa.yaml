title: PowerQUICC CPM Time-slot assigner (TSA) controller

maintainers:
  - Herve Codina <herve.codina@bootlin.com>

description: |
  The TSA is the time-slot assigner that can be found on some
  PowerQUICC SoC.
  Its purpose is to route some TDM time-slots to other internal
  serial controllers.

          The hardware can use four dedicated pins for Tx clock,
          Tx sync, Rx clock and Rx sync or use only two pins,
          Tx/Rx clock and Rx/Rx sync.
          Without the 'fsl,common-rxtx-pins' property, the four
          pins are used. With the 'fsl,common-rxtx-pins' property,
          two pins are used.

            - echo:
                Automatic echo. Rx data is resent on Tx
            - internal-loopback:
                The TDM transmitter is connected to the receiver.
                Data appears on Tx pin.
            - control-loopback:
                The TDM transmitter is connected to the receiver.
                The Tx pin is disconnected.

          Receive frame sync delay in number of bits.
          Indicates the delay between the Rx sync and the first bit of the
