	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Wii U's chipset IPC as a udbg console.
	  These IPC messages can be received by a firmware running on the
	  console's "Starbuck" security coprocessor.

	  This driver bypasses the IPC layer completely.

	  If in doubt, say N here.
