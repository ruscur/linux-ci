	  This adds support for the Lynx "SerDes" devices found on various QorIQ
	  SoCs. There may be up to four SerDes devices on each SoC, and each
	  device supports up to eight lanes. The SerDes is configured by default
	  by the RCW, but this module is necessary in order to support dynamic
	  reconfiguration (such as to support 1G and 10G ethernet on the same
	  interface). The hardware supports a variety of protocols, including
	  Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, and more exotic links such as Interlaken and
	  Aurora. This driver only supports Ethernet, but it will try not to
	  touch lanes configured for other protocols.

	  If you have a QorIQ processor and want to dynamically reconfigure your
	  SerDes, say Y. If this driver is compiled as a module, it will be
	  named phy-fsl-lynx-10g-drv.
